    make

Site file format:
    The site file consists of multiple lines of the form:
    <bp position of site> \tab <mode>

    The modes are:
        o, this fits a single site model with unrestricted selection
        d, this tests for dominance
        t, this tests for two nearby sites, leaving selection unrestricted
        T, this tests for two nearby sites, restricting to additive selection
