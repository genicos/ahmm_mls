cmd line:

./ahmm_mls -i example.panel -s example.sample -m model_file > example.output

The model file contains two lines, one two fit a single locus selection model, and one to fit a two 
locus selection model. These models will be fit to a simulated dataset in which two nearby selected positions
were introduced in a single admixture pulse.
